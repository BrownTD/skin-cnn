# Skin Condition Classifier
A convolutional neural network project for image-based skin condition analysis. Includes model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Goal: Classify facial images into categories like acne, eczema, or clear skin.
- Dataset: Use a public dermatology dataset (e.g., HAM10000 or generate synthetic facial skin data).
- Tech: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch + OpenCV
- Model: Start with a basic CNN (Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPool → Dense)
- Add real-time webcam capture and prediction.

## Structure
- `src/`: Core Python logic
- `data/`: Datasets (excluded from Git)
- `notebooks/`: Prototyping notebooks
- `models/`: Saved model weights
- `outputs/`: Visual results (charts, overlays, logs)
